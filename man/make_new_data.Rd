\title{make_new_data: Generates a new dataset varying in the dimension of interest.}
\usage{
make_new_data(from_part, to_part, fixed_values, dataset, units = NULL,
  specified_units = NULL, comp_labels, lower_quantile = 0.05,
  upper_quantile = 0.95, granularity = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_part}{part to plot transfer out of. Of the two being considered, should be part with generally higher values (e.g. higher median)}

\item{to_part}{part to plot transfer into. Of the two being considered, should be part with generally lower values (e.g. lower median.)}

\item{fixed_values}{Should be a dataframe with a column for each part and containing a single value for each of those.}

\item{dataset}{Dataset to take distribution of \code{from_part} from.}

\item{comp_labels}{Labels of compositional columns.}

\item{lower_quantile}{See \code{vary_time_of_interest}}

\item{upper_quantile}{See \code{vary_time_of_interest}}

\item{granularity}{Doesn't usually need setting. Parameter indicating how many predictions to make. If too low, plotted curve has gaps. If too high, calculation is slow.}

\item{comp_sum}{Numeric value indicating the value compositional columns should sum to (e.g. 1, 24, 168, 10080).}
}
\value{
Dataframe varying in time of interest.
