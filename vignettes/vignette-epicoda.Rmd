## Getting started
We start by loading a (simulated) compositional dataset. 

```{r}
simdataplain <- epicoda::simdataplain
head(simdataplain)
```

This dataset has 5 columns which make up a hypothetical composition, along with a hypothetical sex column and age group column.  
In what sense are the compositional columns 'compositional'?
Compositional data is data where the information is contained in the *relative*, rather than the absolute, values of the components. 

## Investigating the data

## Log-ratio transformations 

## Epidemiological modelling
